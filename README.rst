EdX Repository Skeleton
=======================

A skeleton that can be used as the basis for open-source edX repositories. 
To use this for your repo:

- Copy the files in the root to the root of your repo.
- Decide whether you are using the AGPL or Apache license. If you are unsure,
  ask the open source team.

  - If your repo is AGPL-licensed, copy the files in the agpl directory to your
    root.
  - If your repo is Apache-licensed, copy the files in the apache directory to
    your root.

- Edit all the files to make them appropriate for your repo.
